# Sooyeon Lee — Portfolio

This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website.

The site presents how I approach complex problems through systems-level thinking, connecting product design, emotional frameworks, and education systems rather than isolated solutions.

## Focus Areas
- Patented FemTech product design
- Emotional framework and reflective systems
- Integrated learning systems and curriculum design

- Education systems design and consulting

## Purpose
This portfolio is designed to document real projects and ongoing work, showing how ideas move from structure and constraints to execution.

## Tech Stack
- HTML
- CSS (Flexbox & Grid)
- Vanilla JavaScript
- GitHub Pages

## Live Site
🌐 https://sooyeon.work

## Status
Actively maintained and iterated.
